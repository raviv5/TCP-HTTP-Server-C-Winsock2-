# TCP-HTTP-Server-C-Winsock2-
Developed a multi-verb TCP server using C++ and the Winsock2 API to parse and respond to HTTP/1.1 requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD). Implemented a robust request parser and a modular response generator to handle protocol logic and status codes. Designed the system to process raw socket data, extract request metadata, and serve HTML response.
